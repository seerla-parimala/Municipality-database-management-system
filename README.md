# Municipality-database-management-system
# Description
The Municipality Administration System collects the taxes fromm the citizen of the country and each citizen also has to pa the electricity, water and property bills.
All these work happen at the office of respective departments. A person has to visit every office to know about the taxes , pending bills and any other data related to Municipality. This is not user-friendly and consumes lot of time. 
So to overcome this issue and ease process for citizen, we will design an application through whih citizen can know and pay the tax and bills.
